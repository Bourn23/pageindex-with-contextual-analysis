Understanding the complex mecha-nisms of ion transport within composites is critical fore\ufb00ectively designing high-performance solid electrolytes. This\nstudy examines the compositional dependence of the threedetermining factors for ionic conductivity, including ionmobility, ion transport pathways, and active ion concentration.The results show that with increase in the fraction of ceramicLi\n7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) phase in the LLZO \u2212poly(ethylene\noxide) composites, ion mobility decreases, ion transport\npathways transit from polymer to ceramic routes, and the active ion concentration increases. These changes in ion mobility,transport pathways, and concentration collectively explain the observed trend of ionic conductivity in composite electrolytes.Liquid additives alter ion transport pathways and increase ion mobility, thus enhancing ionic conductivity signi \ufb01cantly. It is also\nfound that a higher content of LLZO leads to improved electrochemical stability of composite electrolytes. This study providesinsight into the recurring observations of compositional dependence of ionic conductivity in current composite electrolytes andpinpoints the intrinsic limitations of composite electrolytes in achieving fast ion conduction.\nKEYWORDS: Li-ion transport, composite electrolyte, isotope replacement, NMR, solid-state batteries\n\u25a0INTRODUCTION\nThe current generation of rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs)\nemploys liquid electrolytes, which are toxic, \ufb02ammable, and\ncorrosive, resulting in signi \ufb01cant safety issues.1\u22124To address\nthese safety issues, in addition to improving the energy density\nof rechargeable LIBs, solid electrolytes are considered a\npromising solution. There are two major types of solidelectrolytes: inorganics (ceramics and glasses) and polymers.5\u22127\nInorganic oxides, such as Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO),\nLi3xLa2/3\u2212xTiO 3(LLTO), and Li 1+xAlxGe2\u2212x(PO 4)3(LAGP),\nhave been widely studied. The ionic conductivity is around 10\u22124\nS/cm at room temperature (RT).8\u221210Ceramic electrolytes are\noften rigid and brittle with low \ufb02exibility, which leads to poor\ncontact and high resistance at the electrolyte \u2212electrode\ninterfaces.11,12Polymers are \ufb02exible and show good contact\nwith electrodes.13\u221215The widely studied polymers, poly-\n(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and poly-(methyl methacrylate), show a low conductivity of 10\n\u22125\u221210\u22128\nS/cm at RT. In addition, polymers exhibit poor thermal and\nchemical stabilities.16\u221218\nTo mitigate the shortcomings of pure polymer or ceramic\nelectrolytes, the potential composite electrolytes have been\nexplored extensively.19In the early studies, nonconductive\noxides, such as Al 2O3, TiO 2, and SiO 2, were dispersed into\npolymer matrix to prepare composite electrolytes. The increaseof conductivity by 2 orders of magnitude was obtainedcompared with that of pure polymer electrolytes.20,21The\nionic conductivity enhancement is attributed to suppression of\npolymer crystallization. The amorphous phase of polymers with\nactive chain segments is believed to promote fast Li-ion\ntransportation.22Generally, the optimal insulating \ufb01ller\nconcentration for ionic conductivity is about 10 wt %. Furtherincrease in the fraction of \ufb01llers results in a conductivity\ndecrease due to dilution and block e \ufb00ects.23,24To overcome the\nlimitation of conventional composite electrolytes with insulat-\ning ceramic \ufb01llers, a few research groups have investigated\nhybrid materials made of polymers and Li-ion conductive\nceramics or glasses.25\u221227In these cases, the optimal fraction of\nactive \ufb01llers varied in a large range. For example, in nanowire\nLLTO\u2212PAN composite electrolytes, the highest conductivity\nwas obtained at 15 wt %.28However, for LAGP \u2212PEO\ncomposite electrolytes, the highest conductivity at RT was\nachieved at 80 wt % of LAGP.29In these composite systems, Li\nions can transport via the polymer matrix, inorganic \ufb01llers, the\norganic \u2212inorganic interfaces, or a combination of the three. Li-\nion transport pathways, together with active Li-ion concen-\ntration and Li-ion mobility, determine the ionic conductivity of\nLi electrolytes. Thus, exploring the mechanism of Li-ion\nReceived: November 13, 2017\nAccepted: January 5, 2018\nPublished: January 5, 2018Research Article\nwww.acsami.org Cite This: ACS Appl. Mater.

A picture of the resulting \ufb02exible, white \ufb01lm made of\nLLZO\u2212PEO (LiTFSI) and a schematic diagram of \ufb01lm\ncomposition are shown in Figure 1 b. The thickness of\ncomposite \ufb01lms ranges from 30 to 50 \u03bcm. To characterize\nthese composite electrolytes, high-resolution solid-state6Li\nMAS NMR was employed ( Figure 1 c). PEO (LiTFSI), pure\ncubic LLZO, and LiTFSI dissolved in TEGDME were used asreferences in the characterizations. Pure cubic LLZO, LiTFSI in\nPEO, and LiTFSI in TEGDME show\n6Li NMR peaks at 2.3,\n0.3, and 0 ppm, respectively. The6Li NMR signal of LLZO at\n2.3 ppm remains the same in all of the composite electrolytes of\ninterest, except that the amount of LLZO is too small to be\nobserved for LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI). In the6Li NMR\nspectra of LLZO \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) composites, a broad shoulderat 1.8 ppm is assigned to the LLZO \u2212PEO interface, which was\nveri\ufb01ed in our previous study.30A new peak at 1.3 ppm is from\ndecomposed LLZO due to the ball-milling process during\ncomposite preparation. The decomposed LLZO is con \ufb01rmed to\nbe Li 2CO 3with high-resolution6Li NMR ( Figure S2 ). The\nintensity of the decomposed LLZO peak is increased when the\nliquid additive TEGDME is added, suggesting that TEGDME\nenhances the breakdown of LLZO. The NMR peak shiftsslightly from 1.3 to 1.2 ppm, likely owing to change of the\nsurrounding matrix of decomposed LLZO from PEO to PEO \u2212\nTEGDME complex. It is also observed that the area integral ofthe interface signal at 1.8 ppm is increased with the addition of\nTEGDME, indicating that more bulk LLZO is converted to\ninterface. More details about the e \ufb00ects of TEGDME are\nshown in Figure S3 and in our prior work.\n32\nThe participation of LLZO in the composite electrolytes\nbroadens the signal of LiTFSI in PEO.

It has been\nestablished that the addition of ceramic \ufb01llers can reduce\npolymer crystallization,22which in turn increases the disorder\nof Li-ion local environments within polymers, manifested asbroadened LiTFSI resonances in\n6Li NMR. A minor reduction\nin the FWHM of the LiTFSI resonance from 0.18 to 0.15 is\nseen with the addition TEGDME to the LLZO \u2212PEO (LiTFSI)\ncomposite. It is expected that liquid TEGDME will enhance Li-ion motion, which partially averages out the environmental\nanisotropy and thus reduces the NMR line width.\nTo probe the Li-ion mobility in the composite electrolytes,\nthe\n7LiT1relaxation times are measured for the LiTFSI and\nLLZO associated phases. The results are shown in Table 1 .\nWith the increase of the LLZO fraction in the composite, the\n7LiT1relaxation times increase for Li in LiTFSI, which suggests\na slowdown of Li-ion motion. The possible reasons are: (i)\nLLZO particles make the composite rigid, which limits the\nmotion of Li ions within the matrix; and (ii) big LLZO particles\nare blocking Li-ion transport channels within the polymer. Bothfactors will result in reduced ion conduction within the polymerphase. The T\n1relaxation times for LLZO-related phases,\nincluding LLZO, LLZO \u2212PEO interface, and decomposed\nLLZO, increase with larger LLZO content. The T1for bulk\nc-LLZO at room temperature is \u223c1 s, which is not expected to\nchange signi \ufb01cantly with increase in LLZO amount in the\ncomposite. It also has been determined in our prior studies thatLi at the LLZO \u2212PEO interface shares the same T\n1\u223c1 s as Li\nin bulk LLZO.32The variation in T1in the LLZO-related\nphases is mainly from the contribution of the decomposed\nLLZO phase, which exhibits very long T1in the LLZO \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) composites, that is, 10 \u221220 s ( Table 1 ). The7LiT1of\ndecomposed LLZO in LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) (50\nwt %)\u2212TEGDME is reduced compared to that in LLZO (50\nwt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI), suggesting increased Li motion in\nTEGDME. The results show that Li-ion mobility decreaseswith increasing LLZO content in the composite, and small\nmolecule additives such as TEGDME render Li ions in the\ncomposite more mobile.\nTo investigate Li-ion transport pathways within the\ncomposite electrolytes, symmetric cells,\n6Li metal |composite\nelectrolyte |6Li metal, were fabricated. These symmetric cells\nwere electrochemically cycled with a current density of 7.2 \u03bcA/\ncm2, and the direction of the current was switched every 5 min.\nThe natural abundance of the6Li isotope is only 7.6%, which is\nlow compared to that of 92.4% for7Li. The slightly biased\npotential induced by the electric current drives6Li ions from\none6Li-enriched metal electrode to pass through the composite\nelectrolyte and reach the other6Li-enriched metal electrode.\nDuring this process,6Li ions partially replace7Li ions in the\ncomposite electrolytes. Therefore, the components comprisingLi-ion transport pathways will be preferentially\n6Li-enriched\nwith repeated electrochemical cycling. Quantitative evaluationof the change in6Li amount for each component within the\ncomposite electrolyte will reveal the preferred pathways for Li-ion transport.\nThe\n6Li NMR spectra of pristine composite electrolytes and\nthose after6Li\u21927Li replacement are shown in Figure 2 . The\nquanti \ufb01cation of6Li enrichment based on spectral area integrals\nis documented in Table 2 . For the LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) composite,6Li enrichment of 23.3% is observed for\nLiTFSI in PEO, suggesting that Li ions pass through the PEO\nmatrix for conduction. In addition to the intensity increase(Figure 2 a), the\n6Li resonance also shifts to the right, an\nindication of change in Li-ion local environments. Li ions\nassociated with crystalline PEO often exhibit a6Li resonance at\n\u223c0.3 ppm, and the resonance tends to shift to lower ppm for Li\nin amorphous PEO due to reduced PEO \u2212Li interactions.32\nTherefore, the shift of the resonance after6Li\u21927Li\nreplacement is a manifestation of weakened Li \u2212PEO\ninteraction; this often facilitates Li-ion conduction.\nWith the increase in LLZO content to 20 wt % in the\ncomposite, that is, LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI), the6Li\nsignals from LLZO, PEO \u2212LLZO interface, decomposed\nLLZO, and LiTFSI can be distinctively observed. After the\n6Li\u21927Li replacement operation, LLZO and interface\nresonances do not show any notable changes, whereas the6Li\namount in decomposed LLZO and LiTFSI increased by 10.6\nand 21.2%, respectively. The preferred6Li enrichment of\ndecomposed LLZO and LiTFSI implies that Li-ion conductionoccurs via Li salts in PEO. Li salts are partially from LiTFSI\ndispersed in PEO and partially from decomposed LLZO. The\nball-milling mixing breaks bulk LLZO into small granules, andthese decomposed LLZO particles are distributed within PEO.The extraordinarily large T\n1(>10 s) of decomposed LLZO\ncompared to that ( \u223c1 s) of other Li-containing components in\nthe composite electrolytes suggests that decomposed LLZO is\nspatially in a separate phase. The lack of1H\u22126Li cross-\npolarization signal for decomposed LLZO infers very weakinteractions between decomposed LLZO and the PEO matrix\n(Figure S4 ). The low strength of the interaction again favors\nfast Li-ion conduction. The lack of bulk LLZO participation inLi conduction in LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) composite\nis likely due to the low LLZO content, which does not allow the\nformation of a percolated network for Li to pass through. In\nsummary, LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) is still a polymer\nelectrolyte modi \ufb01ed by LLZO as \ufb01llers, and its decomposed\nform serves as an additional Li source.\nFor LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) ( Figure 2 c), after\n6Li\n\u21927Li replacement, the6Li peak of bulk LLZO at 2.3 ppm is\nincreased signi \ufb01cantly by 27.2%. In addition, the PEO \u2212LLZO\ninterface and LiTFSI resonances show small6Li enrichment,\n6.3 and 8.7%, respectively. No6Li enrichment is observed for\nthe resonance from decomposed LLZO. Therefore, themajority of Li ions pass through the percolated networkformed by LLZO particles and a small portion transport via\nLiTFSI in PEO. Decomposed LLZO plays a minor role in Li-Table 2.

It is worth noting thatin our previous study on LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiClO\n4)\ncomposite electrolyte, almost all Li ions transport throughLLZO and few of them through LiClO\n4in PEO.30The\ndi\ufb00erence of Li-ion transport pathways in LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212\nPEO (LiTFSI) and LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiClO4)i s\nprecisely from the type of Li salts. In general, Li salts withbulkier anions exhibit higher ionic conductivity. For instance,the conductivity of PEO \u2212LiClO\n4electrolytes is on the order of\n10\u22127S/cm at room temperature, whereas that of PEO \u2212LiTFSI\nelectrolytes is 10\u22125S/cm. LiTFSI with larger anions can\ndissociate in the PEO matrix more easily and release more freeLi ions than LiClO\n4, resulting in signi \ufb01cant conductivity\nenhancement. It is reported that, under similar stoichiometric\nLi concentrations, the measured free Li-ion concentration from\nLiTFSI in polymers is \u223c3.4 times more than that from LiClO4,\nwhich contributes to the observed much higher Li di \ufb00usivity of\nLiTFSI in polymers, \u223c5.3 times more than that of LiClO 4.33\nFrom this perspective, it is not hard to understand that LiTFSI\nin PEO also makes measurable contribution to Li-ion\ntransportation in the LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI)\ncomposite electrolyte.\nTo further explore the in \ufb02uence of chemical environments\non Li-ion pathways, a typical plasticizer, TEGDME, was addedinto LLZO \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) during composite preparation.\nTEGDME has been used as a non \ufb02ammable liquid electrolyte\nfor LIBs, and Li ionic conductivity of TEGDME is 10\n\u22123S/cm\nat room temperature. TEGDME can also reduce PEO\ncrystallization and increase the fraction of amorphous PEOphase, which is believed to account for fast Li-ion transport inPEO\u2212TEGDME composites. It is seen in Figure 2 d that the\naddition of TEGDME has altered Li-ion pathways compared\nwith composites without TEGDME. Bulk LLZO is not the\ndominant component for Li-ion transportation anymore,showing only 7.0%\n6Li enrichment. The integrals of6Li\nresonances from decomposed LLZO and LiTFSI are increasedby 14.8 and 14.0%, respectively. These results indicate that Li\nions transport mainly through Li salts within the PEO \u2212\nTEGDME matrix.\nThe schematic of Li-ion pathways within LLZO \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) composite electrolytes of di \ufb00erent LLZO contents\nis shown in Figure 3 . To summarize, with low LLZO content\n(<20 wt %), LLZO \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) composites behave as a\npolymer electrolyte modi \ufb01ed by LLZO. On increasing LLZO\namount to a critical point, LLZO particles connect to form apercolated network; thus, LLZO \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) compositesfunction as a ceramic electrolyte. However, the ceramic\nparticles are diluted by polymers, and as a result, ceramic\nelectrolytes composed of loose particles exhibit much lowerionic conductivity compared with dense ceramic pellets.Moreover, bulk LLZO particles block Li-ion transport throughthe polymer matrix. Li transport pathways transition from the\nPEO matrix to the percolated LLZO network when the LLZO\nfraction in the composite electrolyte is increased to a criticalpoint. The exact transition point varies depending on manyfactors, including the particle size and morphology of LLZO aswell as the mixing degree of participating components. With\nTEGDME additive, Li-ion conduction occurs mainly through\nTEGDME-modi \ufb01ed polymer phase. The presence of\nTEGDME additive in PEO has been shown to signi \ufb01cantly\nenhance Li-ion conduction.\n34\nThe determination of Li-ion transport pathways also permits\nthe quanti \ufb01cation of the relative concentration of active Li ions\nfor conduction. For LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI), the active\nLi ions are solely from LiTFSI. For LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI), an additional source of active Li ions is the\ndecomposed LLZO, which likely increases the charge carrierconcentration and thus improves the ionic conductivity.35For\nLLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI), the main source of active Li\nions is bulk LLZO, with a minor contribution from LiTFSI. For\nLLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) (50 wt %) \u2212TEGDME,\nactive Li ions are from LiTFSI, decomposed LLZO, and bulkLLZO. It is worth pointing out that although the nominalamount of active Li ions increases with increasing LLZOcontent, the actual fraction of Li ions participating in the\nconduction may be reduced due to decreased ion mobility and\nblockage of pathways in PEO by LLZO particles, which we willdiscuss next.\nThe e \ufb00ects of increasing LLZO content in the LLZO \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) composites on ionic conductivity channel through the\nfollowing three avenues: (i) ion mobility: the T\n1relaxation time\nmeasurements suggest that increasing LLZO contents decreaseion mobility; (ii) ion transport pathways:\n6Li\u21927Li\nreplacement experiments reveal that at a critical LLZO content,\nthe composite will transition from a polymer electrolyte to a\nceramic electrolyte; and (iii) concentration of participating Liions in conduction: composites with <20 wt % LLZO show thatthe concentration of active Li ions rises with increasing LLZOcontent. With large LLZO content, on the one hand, the\nnumber of Li ions originated from LLZO increases. On the\nother hand, likely due to the blockage of Li conductionchannels by LLZO particles, the amount of active Li ions inPEO is reduced. As is seen, LLZO content can have totallyopposite e \ufb00ects on di \ufb00erent parameters that determine ionic\nFigure 3. Schematic of Li-ion pathways within LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI), LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI), LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI), and LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) (50 wt %) \u2212TEGDME composite electrolytes.ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces Research Article\nDOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b17301\nACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 4113 \u221241204117\nconductivity. On the basis of the above analysis, the qualitative\nevaluation of the impact of LLZO on ionic conductivity is asfollows: at low content of LLZO (e.g., 5 wt %), LLZO serves asa\ufb01ller to reduce the crystallinity of PEO. Large LLZO particles\nmay also block the Li-ion pathways in PEO and reduce Li-ionmobility. Whether or not the \ufb01llers at a certain concentration\nenhance or reduce ionic conduction depends on the weighingof the two competing e \ufb00ects. In addition, if the \ufb01ller contains\nLi, it may become an additional source of Li ions participatingin conduction. For instance, in LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI), Li from decomposed LLZO becomes one majorcharge carrier source, which is expected to enhance ionicconductivity. At high content of LLZO (e.g., 50 wt %), LLZO \u2212\nPEO (LiTFSI) becomes an LLZO ceramic conductor. This ispartially due to the formation of a percolated network of LLZO\nparticles to make ion conduction within the LLZO matrix\npossible and partially due to the signi \ufb01cant blockage of ion\nchannels in PEO. Therefore, the ionic conductivity is largelydetermined by loosely connected LLZO particles, of which theionic conductivity is on the order of 10\n\u22126\u221210\u22127S/cm ( Figure\nS5). With the addition of a liquid additive such as TEGDME,\nthe mobility of particles increases, which partially disintegratesthe LLZO network. This has two e \ufb00ects: (i) Li-ion pathway\nthrough the LLZO network is largely broken, and the role ofLLZO in ion conduction is reduced; (ii) it reduces the blockageof Li-ion channels in PEO. In addition, TEGDME furtherreduces PEO crystallinity and enhances ion mobility within thePEO\u2212TEGDME complex. As a result, LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) (50 wt %) \u2212TEGDME becomes predominantly a\npolymer electrolyte modi \ufb01ed by a plasticizer.\nThe ionic conductivities of PEO and LLZO \u2212PEO composite\nelectrolytes with various fractions of LLZO and TEGDME aredetermined by EIS, with the results shown in Figure 4 .\nCompared with PEO (LiTFSI), LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) showed a slight reduction in ionic conductivity.This suggests that blocking e \ufb00ect overweighs the bene \ufb01ts from\nreduced polymer crystallinity. About 1.5-fold conductivityenhancement is observed in LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI);\nthis is largely attributed to the increase in Li salt concentrationfrom the decomposed LLZO ( Figure 2 andTable 2 ). LLZO(50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) shows notably lower ionic\nconductivity compared to that of other composites. This isdue to the fact that LLZO particles almost completely block thepathways through PEO ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ), and the\nalternative pathway through loosely connected LLZO particlesdoes not provide high ionic conductivity. A signi \ufb01cant\nenhancement in ionic conductivity is observed for LLZO (50wt %)\u2212PEO (LiTFSI) (50 wt %) \u2212TEGDME due to increased\nion mobility and re-established ion conduction channels withinTEGDME-modi \ufb01ed PEO.\nThe above discussion reveals various reasons accounting for\nthe observations of changes in the ionic conductivities ofcomposite electrolytes. Solid-state NMR is capable of clearlyidentifying the contributing factors, including ion mobility, iontransport pathways, and active ion concentration, and following\ntheir changes. This helps pinpoint why certain strategies for\nionic conductivity enhancement fail and others work but forreasons other than apparent explanations. For instance, theobserved increase in ionic conductivity for LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212\nPEO (LiTFSI) is merely due to extra Li ions from decomposedLLZO, which has not been identi \ufb01ed and discussed before.\nThis may explain a number of observations in reported studiesthat large ionic conductivity was observed for Li-containing\ufb01llers compared to that for \ufb01llers without Li.\n21\u221227The results\nalso infer that composites with a large content of ceramicparticles in polymers are not likely to produce synergies forionic conductivity enhancement, as the polymer \u2212ceramic\ninterfaces play a very small role in ion conduction.\nDespite the fact that high content of LLZO does not lead to\nhigh ionic conductivity, it increases the stability of thecomposite when used in solid-state batteries with Li metal asthe anode. Symmetric cells made of Li metal electrodes andPEO or composite electrolytes are cycled with a constantcurrent of 15 \u03bcA/cm\n2, and the current direction is switched\nevery 60 min. The cell voltage pro \ufb01le as a function of cycling\ntime is presented in Figure S6 . The cell voltage increases over\ntime for all electrolytes, indicating the increase of impedanceinduced by electrochemical instability. The voltage of PEOreached 10 V after 366 cycles. With the addition of LLZO, thestability improved signi \ufb01cantly. LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) was cycled for 743 times before arriving at 10 V,and LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) lasted for 920 cycles\nbefore arriving at 5 V.\n\u25a0CONCLUSIONS\nIon conduction within composite electrolytes is very complex.As in single-component ion conductors, active ion concen-tration, mobility, and transport pathways determine ionicconductivity. The variations of these three parameters and theirinterplay within the multiple phases of composite electrolytesfurther complicate the mechanism for ion conduction. Thestudy has employed solid-state NMR to determine ion mobility,ion transport pathways, and active concentration in LLZO \u2212\nPEO composite electrolytes and their compositional depend-ence. The results have revealed that with increasing LLZOcontent, ion mobility decreas es; ion transport pathways\ngradually transition from PEO phase to percolated network\nmade of loosely connected LLZO particles; and the active Li-ion concentration increases in general but with certain loss dueto LLZO-blocked pathways in the polymer phase.

Solid-state NMR is a powerful tool to dissect these factors. The study highlights that increasing LLZO content has varied effects on these parameters, explaining the observed non-linear changes in ionic conductivity and revealing the significant role of decomposed LLZO and plasticizers like TEGDME. While high LLZO content improves stability, it does not necessarily lead to higher ionic conductivity."

      "text": "conductivity. On the basis of the above analysis, the qualitative\nevaluation of the impact of LLZO on ionic conductivity is asfollows: at low content of LLZO (e.g., 5 wt %), LLZO serves asa\ufb01ller to reduce the crystallinity of PEO. Large LLZO particles\nmay also block the Li-ion pathways in PEO and reduce Li-ionmobility. Whether or not the \ufb01llers at a certain concentration\nenhance or reduce ionic conduction depends on the weighingof the two competing e \ufb00ects. In addition, if the \ufb01ller contains\nLi, it may become an additional source of Li ions participatingin conduction. For instance, in LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI), Li from decomposed LLZO becomes one majorcharge carrier source, which is expected to enhance ionicconductivity. At high content of LLZO (e.g., 50 wt %), LLZO \u2212\nPEO (LiTFSI) becomes an LLZO ceramic conductor. This ispartially due to the formation of a percolated network of LLZO\nparticles to make ion conduction within the LLZO matrix\npossible and partially due to the signi \ufb01cant blockage of ion\nchannels in PEO. Therefore, the ionic conductivity is largelydetermined by loosely connected LLZO particles, of which theionic conductivity is on the order of 10\n\u22126\u221210\u22127S/cm ( Figure\nS5). With the addition of a liquid additive such as TEGDME,\nthe mobility of particles increases, which partially disintegratesthe LLZO network. This has two e \ufb00ects: (i) Li-ion pathway\nthrough the LLZO network is largely broken, and the role ofLLZO in ion conduction is reduced; (ii) it reduces the blockageof Li-ion channels in PEO. In addition, TEGDME furtherreduces PEO crystallinity and enhances ion mobility within thePEO\u2212TEGDME complex. As a result, LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) (50 wt %) \u2212TEGDME becomes predominantly a\npolymer electrolyte modi \ufb01ed by a plasticizer.\nThe ionic conductivities of PEO and LLZO \u2212PEO composite\nelectrolytes with various fractions of LLZO and TEGDME aredetermined by EIS, with the results shown in Figure 4 .\nCompared with PEO (LiTFSI), LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) showed a slight reduction in ionic conductivity.This suggests that blocking e \ufb00ect overweighs the bene \ufb01ts from\nreduced polymer crystallinity. About 1.5-fold conductivityenhancement is observed in LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI);\nthis is largely attributed to the increase in Li salt concentrationfrom the decomposed LLZO ( Figure 2 andTable 2 ). LLZO(50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) shows notably lower ionic\nconductivity compared to that of other composites. This isdue to the fact that LLZO particles almost completely block thepathways through PEO ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ), and the\nalternative pathway through loosely connected LLZO particlesdoes not provide high ionic conductivity. A signi \ufb01cant\nenhancement in ionic conductivity is observed for LLZO (50wt %)\u2212PEO (LiTFSI) (50 wt %) \u2212TEGDME due to increased\nion mobility and re-established ion conduction channels withinTEGDME-modi \ufb01ed PEO.\nThe above discussion reveals various reasons accounting for\nthe observations of changes in the ionic conductivities ofcomposite electrolytes. Solid-state NMR is capable of clearlyidentifying the contributing factors, including ion mobility, iontransport pathways, and active ion concentration, and following\ntheir changes. This helps pinpoint why certain strategies for\nionic conductivity enhancement fail and others work but forreasons other than apparent explanations. For instance, theobserved increase in ionic conductivity for LLZO (20 wt %) \u2212\nPEO (LiTFSI) is merely due to extra Li ions from decomposedLLZO, which has not been identi \ufb01ed and discussed before.\nThis may explain a number of observations in reported studiesthat large ionic conductivity was observed for Li-containing\ufb01llers compared to that for \ufb01llers without Li.\n21\u221227The results\nalso infer that composites with a large content of ceramicparticles in polymers are not likely to produce synergies forionic conductivity enhancement, as the polymer \u2212ceramic\ninterfaces play a very small role in ion conduction.\nDespite the fact that high content of LLZO does not lead to\nhigh ionic conductivity, it increases the stability of thecomposite when used in solid-state batteries with Li metal asthe anode. Symmetric cells made of Li metal electrodes andPEO or composite electrolytes are cycled with a constantcurrent of 15 \u03bcA/cm\n2, and the current direction is switched\nevery 60 min. The cell voltage pro \ufb01le as a function of cycling\ntime is presented in Figure S6 . The cell voltage increases over\ntime for all electrolytes, indicating the increase of impedanceinduced by electrochemical instability. The voltage of PEOreached 10 V after 366 cycles. With the addition of LLZO, thestability improved signi \ufb01cantly. LLZO (5 wt %) \u2212PEO\n(LiTFSI) was cycled for 743 times before arriving at 10 V,and LLZO (50 wt %) \u2212PEO (LiTFSI) lasted for 920 cycles\nbefore arriving at 5 V.\n\u25a0CONCLUSIONS\nIon conduction within composite electrolytes is very complex.As in single-component ion conductors, active ion concen-tration, mobility, and transport pathways determine ionicconductivity. The variations of these three parameters and theirinterplay within the multiple phases of composite electrolytesfurther complicate the mechanism for ion conduction. Thestudy has employed solid-state NMR to determine ion mobility,ion transport pathways, and active concentration in LLZO \u2212\nPEO composite electrolytes and their compositional depend-ence. The results have revealed that with increasing LLZOcontent, ion mobility decreas es; ion transport pathways\ngradually transition from PEO phase to percolated network\nmade of loosely connected LLZO particles; and the active Li-ion concentration increases in general but with certain loss dueto LLZO-blocked pathways in the polymer phase. Thecompositional dependence of these three parameters explainsthe observed ionic conductivity in this work and also sheds lighton many reported ionic conductivity measurements of\nFigure 4.

      "summary": "This partial document describes the complex mechanisms governing ionic conductivity in LLZO-PEO composite electrolytes, investigating the impact of varying LLZO content and the addition of a liquid additive (TEGDME).\n\nKey points covered include:\n*   **Effect of LLZO concentration on ionic conductivity:**\n    *   **Low LLZO (5 wt%)** slightly reduces conductivity due to particle blocking outweighing reduced PEO crystallinity.\n    *   **Medium LLZO (20 wt%)** enhances conductivity, primarily attributed to additional Li ions released from decomposed LLZO.\n    *   **High LLZO (50 wt%)** results in lower conductivity, as LLZO particles block PEO pathways and the alternative conduction through loosely connected LLZO particles is inefficient.\n*   **Role of TEGDME additive:** Adding TEGDME to high LLZO composites significantly enhances ionic conductivity by reducing PEO crystallinity, improving ion mobility, and re-establishing ion conduction channels within the PEO-TEGDME complex.\n*   **Methodology and insights:** Solid-state NMR is highlighted as a crucial tool for identifying contributing factors like ion mobility, transport pathways, and active ion concentration, revealing that observed conductivity changes are often due to previously unacknowledged reasons (e.g., Li from decomposed LLZO).\n*   **Electrochemical stability:** Despite not always leading to higher conductivity, high LLZO content significantly improves the electrochemical stability of the composite electrolytes in solid-state lithium metal batteries.\n*   **Overall conclusion:** Ion conduction in composite electrolytes is complex, influenced by active ion concentration, mobility, and transport pathways.

Although their application in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) has been widely studied, their surface chemistry which is influenced by their hygroscopic nature is often neglected. This work reports on how the thermal treatment and the consequent elimination of secondary phases at the LIZO\u2013PEO interface impacts the microstructure of the garnet-rich CPEs, which in turn affects their mechanical and ion-transport properties. It is shown that LIZO heat treatment restricts local polymer chain motions, indicating reinforcement of PEO/LIZO interactions which enhances the mechanical strength and homogeneity of the CPEs. These micro-scale modifications of CPEs eventually increase their ionic conductivity and improve the solid electrolyte/lithium metal interface. Thus, the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange at the PEO/LIZO interface was studied by using <sup>7</sup>Li\u2013<sup>7</sup>Li exchange spectroscopy\u2014 nuclear magnetic resonance, and it was observed that after LIZO heat treatment, the interfacial Li<sup>+</sup> exchange has significantly decreased, in line with a lower LiOH content. This result confirms the role of LiOH as an intermediate in the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange reaction and that surface chemistry plays a more important role in the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange than the local Li mobilities in the individual phases.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

L\u00f3pez del Amo).\n\nelectrolytes (CPEs); combining the previous two, to ideally combine the high conductivity of inorganics with the better interfacial properties of polymers.\n\n\npoly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is the most widely used polymer in CPES [10]. However, other polymers such as polyethylene carbonate and polycaprolactone have also been successfully used [11]. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) with its bulky anion structure is the most common Li salt in studying CPEs, although lithium perchlorate (LiClO<sub>4</sub>) and lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTF) have also been investigated [12\u201314]. Among Li<sup>+</sup> conductors, Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, (LLZO) garnets are the top candidates, because they offer a very high ionic conductivity at room temperature [15], can effectively increase the electrochemical stability of the composites [16], and improve the interface with Li metal [17]. Therefore, this study focuses on CPEs made of PEO/ LiTFSI and LLZO.\n\nMost studies on CPEs focus on ceramic-in-polymer systems with a low fraction of the inorganic phase. It has been shown that the addition of a small amount of filler successfully improves the ionic conductivity of the CPE. These improvements are usually associated with the modification of the polymer phase by decreasing its crystallinity [18-20]. However, Wieczorek et al. [21] pointed out that the Lewis acid-base nature of the interactions between the polyether host and the inorganic fillers affects the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity. Further, Wang et al. [22] compared the effect of Li-conducting (active) fillers with non-conducting (passive) fillers and attributed the improvement of the ionic conductivity to the filler/polymer interface. Zaman et al. [23] reported similar observations in a PEO/LLZO system with 15 vol% LLZO. Nevertheless, in all cases, the inorganic active filler does not contribute to the ion transport, due to the filler fraction being below its percolation threshold and no continuous network is formed. Consequently, no long-range Li-ion conduction occurs through the ceramic phase [16]. An approach toward improving LLZO contribution in ionic conductivity is increasing its content, and moving from ceramic-in-polymer to polymer-in-ceramic electrolytes. These composites, which have recently attracted huge attention, are very interesting from a fundamental point of view, as larger fractions of LLZO increase the ceramic-polymer interfaces and the Li<sup>+</sup> transport pathway is more complex. Furthermore, with the incorporation of a higher amount of LLZO, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of the electrolyte can be improved [16,18,24].\n\nOne of the major drawbacks of LLZO is the very fast H<sup>+</sup>/Li exchange reaction after exposure to humidity, forming a layer of LiOH which turns into Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> upon reaction with CO<sub>2</sub> [25\u201327]. Due to their hygroscopic nature, in most cases, the LLZO surface is covered by secondary phases such as LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. In our previous study [28], we showed that a heat treatment at 750 \u00b0C is highly effective in removing these secondary phases and improves the processability of garnet-rich composites. In addition, it was shown that this heat treatment significantly enhances Li<sup>+</sup> dynamics in the LLZO, which could reflect in their ionic conductivity. In this work, we investigate in more detail the impact of the LLZO heat treatment on the morphological, mechanical, and Li transport properties of garnet-rich CPEs, as well as the impact of heat treatment on the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange at PEO/LLZO interface. Finally, we assess the electrochemical properties and interface with Li metal of the symmetric cells to demonstrate the suitable performance of the optimized solid electrolytes.\n\n## 2. Experimental section\n\nCommercial LLZO (Li<sub>6.75</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.75</sub>Nb<sub>0.25</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) purchased from Toshima was used in this work. The powders were first ball-milled to reduce the particle size. Part of the powders was placed in a\n\nfurnace at 750  $^{\\circ}$ C for 12 h to remove the decomposition products from their surface and obtain heat-treated LIZO.\n\nA soft ball-milling procedure was used for the preparation of the garnet-rich composite electrolytes. Poly(ethylene-oxide) (PEO,  $1 \\times 10^6$  g/mol, Sigma Aldrich) was mixed with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Solvionic), LLZO, and acetonitrile (ACN, Sigma Aldrich). The EO:Li ratio of 20:1 was kept constant in all samples. The mixture was ball-milled for 25 min in 5-min intervals with a frequency of 350 rpm, and then cast in 4 mm Teflon evaporating dishes. The solvent was evaporated at room temperature under continuous argon flow overnight. The membranes were later dried at 50 C under dynamic vacuum to ensure complete solvent evaporation. Finally, solid membrane electrolytes with a thickness of 120 \u03bcm were carefully removed from the evaporating dish using a tweezer. Except for the ball-milling which was performed inside air-tight jars, all the preparation and handling of the membranes were done in an Ar-filled glove box. The composites made of 80 wt% pristine and heat-treated LLZO are referred to as CP80 and CA80 hereinafter.\n\nThe micrographs were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM Quanta FEG 250) by applying an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and utilizing an Everhart-Thornley detector. Particle size distribution was analyzed using a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern Panalytical).\n\nThe stress\u2014strain curves of the CPEs were evaluated at room temperature with a TST350 tensile device from Linkam Scientific Instruments at a strain rate of 15  $\\mu m/s$ . For each sample, the mechanical curves were tested in triplicate with dimensions of 10  $\\times$  7  $\\times$  0.1 mm. Young modulus was obtained through the tangent method in the elastic region at 3% of deformation.\n\nAll magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer, a 2.5 mm probe and a MAS frequency of 20 kHz.  $^1\\text{H}$  and  $^7\\text{Li}$  chemical shifts were referenced to bulk water and 0.1 M LiCl aqueous solution, respectively.  $^7\\text{Li}$  1D spectra were recorded using single excitation pulses of 2.4  $\\mu s$  and a relaxation delay of 250 s. For the  $^1\\text{H}$  1D spectra, Hahn echo experiments were used in which a  $\\pi/2$  pulse (1.9  $\\mu s$ ) is followed by a  $\\pi$  pulse (3.8  $\\mu s$ ), and the recycle delay is set to 5s.  $^1\\text{H}-^7\\text{Li}$  Heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) experiments were recorded applying a cross polarization (CP)  $^1\\text{H}-^7\\text{Li}$  magnetization transfer step of 1 ms.  $^7\\text{Li}-^7\\text{Li}$  exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) correlations were obtained using standard three  $\\pi/2$  pulse experiments of 1.9  $\\mu s$ .\n\nThe combined CP-EXSY experiment shown in Fig. 5d was performed by using an initial <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>6</sup>Li CP step followed by a <sup>6</sup>Li-<sup>6</sup>Li EXSY, with a mixing time of 1.6 ms and relaxation delay of 3 s.\n\nThe electrochemical impedance spectra of the CPEs were recorded using a Biologic VPM3 with AC in the frequency range of 1 MHz\u20131 Hz at an excitation voltage of 10 mV. The cells were prepared with stainless steel\u2014blocking electrodes and the spectra were recorded at the temperature range of 30\u201380 \u00b0C with 10 \u00b0C intervals. The ionic conductivities were calculated using equation (1).\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{d}{A \\cdot R} \\tag{1}$$\n",

However, other polymers such as polyethylene carbonate and polycaprolactone have also been successfully used [11]. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) with its bulky anion structure is the most common Li salt in studying CPEs, although lithium perchlorate (LiClO<sub>4</sub>) and lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTF) have also been investigated [12\u201314]. Among Li<sup>+</sup> conductors, Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, (LLZO) garnets are the top candidates, because they offer a very high ionic conductivity at room temperature [15], can effectively increase the electrochemical stability of the composites [16], and improve the interface with Li metal [17]. Therefore, this study focuses on CPEs made of PEO/ LiTFSI and LLZO.\n\nMost studies on CPEs focus on ceramic-in-polymer systems with a low fraction of the inorganic phase. It has been shown that the addition of a small amount of filler successfully improves the ionic conductivity of the CPE. These improvements are usually associated with the modification of the polymer phase by decreasing its crystallinity [18-20]. However, Wieczorek et al. [21] pointed out that the Lewis acid-base nature of the interactions between the polyether host and the inorganic fillers affects the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity. Further, Wang et al. [22] compared the effect of Li-conducting (active) fillers with non-conducting (passive) fillers and attributed the improvement of the ionic conductivity to the filler/polymer interface. Zaman et al. [23] reported similar observations in a PEO/LLZO system with 15 vol% LLZO. Nevertheless, in all cases, the inorganic active filler does not contribute to the ion transport, due to the filler fraction being below its percolation threshold and no continuous network is formed. Consequently, no long-range Li-ion conduction occurs through the ceramic phase [16]. An approach toward improving LLZO contribution in ionic conductivity is increasing its content, and moving from ceramic-in-polymer to polymer-in-ceramic electrolytes. These composites, which have recently attracted huge attention, are very interesting from a fundamental point of view, as larger fractions of LLZO increase the ceramic-polymer interfaces and the Li<sup>+</sup> transport pathway is more complex. Furthermore, with the incorporation of a higher amount of LLZO, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of the electrolyte can be improved [16,18,24].",

Experimental section\n\nCommercial LLZO (Li<sub>6.75</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.75</sub>Nb<sub>0.25</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) purchased from Toshima was used in this work. The powders were first ball-milled to reduce the particle size. Part of the powders was placed in a\n\nfurnace at 750  $^{\\circ}$ C for 12 h to remove the decomposition products from their surface and obtain heat-treated LIZO.\n\nA soft ball-milling procedure was used for the preparation of the garnet-rich composite electrolytes. Poly(ethylene-oxide) (PEO,  $1 \\times 10^6$  g/mol, Sigma Aldrich) was mixed with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Solvionic), LLZO, and acetonitrile (ACN, Sigma Aldrich). The EO:Li ratio of 20:1 was kept constant in all samples. The mixture was ball-milled for 25 min in 5-min intervals with a frequency of 350 rpm, and then cast in 4 mm Teflon evaporating dishes. The solvent was evaporated at room temperature under continuous argon flow overnight. The membranes were later dried at 50 C under dynamic vacuum to ensure complete solvent evaporation. Finally, solid membrane electrolytes with a thickness of 120 \u03bcm were carefully removed from the evaporating dish using a tweezer. Except for the ball-milling which was performed inside air-tight jars, all the preparation and handling of the membranes were done in an Ar-filled glove box. The composites made of 80 wt% pristine and heat-treated LLZO are referred to as CP80 and CA80 hereinafter.\n\nThe micrographs were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM Quanta FEG 250) by applying an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and utilizing an Everhart-Thornley detector. Particle size distribution was analyzed using a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern Panalytical).\n\nThe stress\u2014strain curves of the CPEs were evaluated at room temperature with a TST350 tensile device from Linkam Scientific Instruments at a strain rate of 15  $\\mu m/s$ . For each sample, the mechanical curves were tested in triplicate with dimensions of 10  $\\times$  7  $\\times$  0.1 mm. Young modulus was obtained through the tangent method in the elastic region at 3% of deformation.\n\nAll magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer, a 2.5 mm probe and a MAS frequency of 20 kHz.  $^1\\text{H}$  and  $^7\\text{Li}$  chemical shifts were referenced to bulk water and 0.1 M LiCl aqueous solution, respectively.  $^7\\text{Li}$  1D spectra were recorded using single excitation pulses of 2.4  $\\mu s$  and a relaxation delay of 250 s. For the  $^1\\text{H}$  1D spectra, Hahn echo experiments were used in which a  $\\pi/2$  pulse (1.9  $\\mu s$ ) is followed by a  $\\pi$  pulse (3.8  $\\mu s$ ), and the recycle delay is set to 5s.  $^1\\text{H}-^7\\text{Li}$  Heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) experiments were recorded applying a cross polarization (CP)  $^1\\text{H}-^7\\text{Li}$  magnetization transfer step of 1 ms.  $^7\\text{Li}-^7\\text{Li}$  exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) correlations were obtained using standard three  $\\pi/2$  pulse experiments of 1.9  $\\mu s$ .\n\nThe combined CP-EXSY experiment shown in Fig. 5d was performed by using an initial <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>6</sup>Li CP step followed by a <sup>6</sup>Li-<sup>6</sup>Li EXSY, with a mixing time of 1.6 ms and relaxation delay of 3 s.\n\nThe electrochemical impedance spectra of the CPEs were recorded using a Biologic VPM3 with AC in the frequency range of 1 MHz\u20131 Hz at an excitation voltage of 10 mV. The cells were prepared with stainless steel\u2014blocking electrodes and the spectra were recorded at the temperature range of 30\u201380 \u00b0C with 10 \u00b0C intervals. The ionic conductivities were calculated using equation (1).\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{d}{A \\cdot R} \\tag{1}$$\n\n\nwhere *d* is the electrolyte thickness, A is its surface area and R is the electrolyte resistance, obtained from the impedance spectrum.\n\nCyclic voltammetry was conducted using a Biologic VPM3 in a potential range of -0.5 to 2.5 V vs. Li $^{\\circ}/\\text{Li}^{+}$ , at a scan rate of 10 mV/s for 10 scans. The measurements were performed on Li metal/CPE/stainless steel cells at 70  $^{\\circ}\\text{C}$  and the cells were conditioned for 2 h at this temperature prior to measurement.\n\nThe Li plating/stripping tests were performed on Li symmetrical cells using a Maccor Series 4000 at 70 \u00b0C and a current density of 40  $\\mu\\text{A/cm}^2$ . The cycling was stopped after ~500 h, to collect the electrochemical impedance spectra, and resumed at 80  $\\mu\\text{A/cm}^2$ . The impedance spectra of Li symmetrical cells both before and after cycling was recorded at 70 \u00b0C and with the same parameters mentioned above. The equivalent circuit model used for fitting the impedance data consists of a resistance element for external resistance in series with two R//CPE blocks, corresponding to the bulk and electrode/electrolyte interface resistance.\n\n## 3. Results and discussions\n\nTo begin with, the impact of heat treatment on the particle size distribution of the ball-milled LLZO powders was studied. As demonstrated in Fig. S.1, it was observed that overall, the LLZO particle size and agglomeration were decreased, which could be attributed to the elimination of LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> layers upon heat treatment. In the next step, garnet-rich composites with 80 wt% pristine and heat-treated LLZO were prepared to investigate the impact of LLZO heat-treatment at 750 \u00b0C as a pre-processing step on different properties of CPEs.\n\nTo understand the morphology and garnet\u2014polymer interface in each sample, SEM analysis was performed. The micrograph of CP80 (Fig. 1a and c) shows that LLZO particles are agglomerated, and the two phases (polymer and ceramic) are segregated. On the other hand, in the case of CA80 (Fig. 1b and d), LLZO particles are uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix. Almost all LLZO particles are homogenously covered by PEO and the polymer distribution is rather uniform. The improved LLZO wetting by the polymer implies stronger interactions between PEO and LLZO after the heat treatment. From the comparison of the SEM images, a better LLZO\u2014PEO interface in the membrane with heat-treated LLZO is evident, likely due to the removal of LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> from the LLZO surface upon\n\nheat treatment. When the garnet fraction is increased to 90 wt%, the heat treatment and the improvement of the interface will be even more relevant, due to the increase of the solid-solid interfaces. Moreover, with a fraction as high as 90 wt% LLZO, the heat treatment becomes imperative for the successful processing of self-standing membranes [28].\n\nIn solid-state batteries, the evaluation of the mechanical properties of solid electrolytes is essential as they affect battery safety and performance [29,30]. Therefore, tensile tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical strength of CPEs and the LLZO-free PEO/LiTFSI membranes described in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the characteristic mechanical response for solid polymer electrolytes, where a typical thermoplastic behavior is observed, with two characteristic regions, the elastic, and the plastic regimes. It can be observed that the addition of LLZO improves the mechanical properties of the membranes, in the sense that the ceramic particles act as mechanical reinforcement. Table 1 presents the Young's modulus, yield stress, and elongation at break of each sample. PEO/ LiTFSI membrane shows the lowest yield stress (0.41 MPa) but the highest elongation at break. CA80 on the other hand, possesses the highest yield stress (0.91 MPa), with a Young's modulus similar to CP80 (~35 MPa) but considerably higher than the one of PEO/LiTFSI (2.1 MPa), indicating that the addition of LLZO increases the stiffness of the membranes. CP80 shows a significantly lower elongation at break (42.7 %) compared to CA80 and PEO/LiTFSI (109.8 and 83.7%), which is in line with its phase-segregated microstructure in which LLZO particles are agglomerated and PEO matrix is not uniformly distributed. The lower yield stress of CP80 can also be explained by the poor PEO/LLZO interactions, in agreement with SEM micrographs. On the contrary, in CA80 the homogenous distribution of PEO and the stronger PEO/LLZO interactions (wettability of the LLZO by the polymer) noticeably increase the yield stress and the elongation at break. Overall, the mechanical properties of CA80 are suitable for solid-state batteries [31]. In any case,\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

Fig. 2 shows the characteristic mechanical response for solid polymer electrolytes, where a typical thermoplastic behavior is observed, with two characteristic regions, the elastic, and the plastic regimes.

Overall, the mechanical properties of CA80 are suitable for solid-state batteries [31]. In any case,\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

Despite a lower resolution, <sup>7</sup> Li was preferred over <sup>6</sup> Li, due to its higher sensibility and shorter relaxation time. The <sup>7</sup> Li MAS-NMR spectra of CA80 and CP80 are shown in [Fig. 3a](#page-3-2). In the latter, two main signals are observed centered at 1.3 and 0.5 ppm, corresponding to the Li<sup>\u00fe</sup> in the polymer matrix and LLZO, respectively [\\[35,](#page-7-28)[36](#page-8-0)]. Comparing the two spectra, a clear difference in the Li signal of LLZO and Li ions in the polymer phase is observed. In CA80, the <sup>7</sup> Li signal of LLZO at 1.2 ppm is evidently narrower (207 Hz) than the one of CP80 centered at 0.5 ppm (550 Hz). Linewidth (FWHM), in NMR experiments, is generally related to the local dynamics, as anisotropic interactions can be averaged out with fast ion or molecular motions [[37,](#page-8-1)[38](#page-8-2)]. Variable temperature NMR experiments are desirable to separate the effect of dynamics from the intrinsic broadenings due to the local chemical environments. However, such experiments are complicated in composites where multiple overlapped signals are present. On the other hand, considering the similar chemical compositions of CP80 and CA80, the intrinsic broadening due to the local chemical environment is assumed to be similar, we can conclude that the differences in the linewidth are the consequences of local dynamics.\n\nThe sharper <sup>7</sup> Li signal of LLZO in CA80 is assigned to the formation of the highly conductive cubic phase after heat treatment, the elimination of protons from the LLZO structure, and the removal of Li2CO3 and LiOH from the LLZO surface [[28](#page-7-21)]. As a result of this lower linewidth, the signals are less overlapped and better resolved. This line narrowing is accompanied by a slight shift toward higher ppm values, probably related to phase changes and\n\n<span id=\"page-3-2\"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_10.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of a) <sup>7</sup> Li and b) <sup>1</sup> H NMR spectra of CP80 and CA80.\n\nLLZO deprotonation, slightly affecting the Li\u00fe environment. Interestingly, the <sup>7</sup> Li signal at 1.3 ppm belonging to the Li salt dissolved in the polymer matrix is narrower in the CP80 (40 Hz) than in CA80 (86 Hz), implying faster local mobilities of Li ions in the PEO phase. This is well in agreement with the <sup>1</sup> H 1D spectra, presented in [Fig. 3](#page-3-2)b, in which the linewidth of the <sup>1</sup> H signal in CP80 (74 Hz) is lower than in the CA80 (171 Hz). These results indicate that both PEO matrix and the Li ions dissolved in the polymer show higher mobility in CP80. This can be explained by the inhomogeneous distribution of LLZO, the segregation of LLZO and polymer phases and the weak interactions between the LLZO and PEO matrix. On the other hand, in CA80, the PEO mobility is restricted due to a stronger interaction of the PEO and the 'clean' LLZO surface. Since the polymer dynamics and the local mobilities of Li\u00fe ions in PEO are generally correlated, slower Li dynamics are also observed in CA80. These strong surface interactions are also responsible for the optimum polymer dispersion and improved mechanical properties.\n\nA key aspect of the development of composite electrolytes is the ability of Li<sup>\u00fe</sup> ions to rapidly diffuse through the garnetepolymer interface. If the exchange rate is fast enough, this phenomenon could greatly affect the Li-ion pathways through the membranes and the observed conductivities. In our previous investigations on ceramic-polymer composite electrolytes with 10 vol% LLZO [35,36], the Li-ion exchange in the interface was observed and followed by NMR. However, the activation energy for this process was found to be too high for the contribution of this Li<sup>+</sup> exchange process to the total ionic conductivity of the membranes [35]. Since the presence of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> with its slow Li<sup>+</sup> dynamics on the surface of the LLZO particles could block or slow down the ion exchange and be responsible for the high activation energy of this process, it was expected that removing them through heat treatment could facilitate the exchange in the interface. On the other hand, in a previous work, LiOH was proposed as a possible intermediate for the Li+ exchange. Solid-state 2D EXSY NMR experiments were carried out in this work to assess the effect of heat pre-treatment of the LLZO particles in the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange in CP80 and CA80.\n\nFig. 4 shows <sup>7</sup>Li-<sup>7</sup>Li EXSY NMR experiments performed on CPEs with a mixing time of 600 ms. The signals on the diagonal line at 0.4 and \u22121.3 ppm correspond to the Li ions in the LLZO and polymer matrix respectively, while the off-diagonal signals (cross-peaks) connecting both signals indicate the amplitude of Li exchange existing between the two chemical environments within the mixing time of the experiment (0.6 s). By the inspection of the figures, it is clear that the off-diagonal signals in the case of CA80 are smaller than CP80. This is also confirmed by the calculation of the relative integral volumes of the off-diagonal signals with respect to the main diagonal ones. The obtained values are 7.6% in CA80 and 27.1% in CP80. Since the off-diagonal signals correlating the Li signals at the LLZO and PEO sites are proportional to the number of the exchanged ions, we can conclude that a higher number of Li-ions are subject to the Li-exchange in CP80, meaning that heat treatment of the LLZO particles has a negative impact on the amplitude of Li exchange between the PEO and LLZO phases. This can be assigned to the intermediate role of LiOH in the exchange, as suggested by Ranque et al. [35]. After the heat treatment, the LiOH is removed from the LLZO surface, and in the absence of this intermediate phase, fewer Li ions can move between the LLZO and the polymer matrix. It is important to highlight that the negative impact of removing LiOH in the exchange is even more remarkable considering that the extent of the LLZO-PEO interaction (LLZO wettability by the polymer) is much higher in the CA80 sample.\n\nThe decrease in the amount of LiOH in the composite was studied by  ${}^{1}\\text{H}-{}^{7}\\text{Li}$  HETCOR experiments, shown in Fig. 5a and b. The projections of the HETCOR spectra on the  ${}^{1}\\text{H}$  dimension were extracted and are presented in Fig. 5c. Three signals can be observed at -2.1, 0.8, and 3.6 ppm, corresponding to LiOH, water molecules adsorbed on the LLZO surface, and protons inside the\n\nLLZO structure respectively [28]. All these three spin reservoirs do result in signals in the  ${}^{1}H-{}^{7}Li$  correlation, due to the presence of distinct <sup>1</sup>H to <sup>7</sup>Li couples in the materials. Signals obtained from CP experiments are generally not quantitative, as they are strongly affected by differences in internuclear distances and local motions. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that these factors are not much different for the same compounds in different samples. Fig. 5c clearly shows a considerably lower amount of LiOH, as well as protons inside LLZO in CA80. However, as shown in Fig. S.1, the middle signal at 0.8 ppm which is assigned to adsorbed water molecules on the LLZO surface, has a similar intensity in both CP80 and CA80, indicating a limit for possible water adsorption on the LLZO surface. In CP80, the correlation of this signal with <sup>7</sup>Li is less clear in Fig. 5a and c because the signals corresponding to LiOH and protons inside the LLZO are more intense, and the intermediate signal is overlapped. Nevertheless, its presence is confirmed by the deconvolutions shown in Fig. S.2.\n\n\nTo highlight the role of LiOH in the Li exchange, a pseudo-3D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>6</sup>Li CP experiment was conducted. In this experiment, the EXSY step is included after a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>6</sup>Li CP block to increase the signal of the less mobile units (LiOH in this case). CP signals are based on dipolar couplings, hence the signal coming from rigid compounds with lower H-Li distances would be more intense. However, for the same reason, CP signals are not quantitative. The results presented in Fig. 5d, demonstrate the presence of Li exchange between LiOH and LLZO, as well as between LiOH and PEO in CP80, where a high amount of LiOH exists. However, in the CA80 the signals are extremely weak, and no cross-peak is observed. A comparison of signal intensity in CP80 and CA80 is presented in Fig. S.2. It can be concluded that LiOH plays a critical role in the Li exchange in the LLZO-PEO interface. Therefore, LLZO heat treatment limits the Li exchange by eliminating the intermediate LiOH. The results suggest that the Li exchange is more affected by the surface chemistry of LLZO rather than the Li dynamics in LLZO and confirms the role of LiOH as an intermediate of the exchange. It must be noted that these observations are within the timescale used in the experiment (tens to hundreds of milliseconds), and the possibility of a direct Li exchange between LLZO and PEO (without involvement of LiOH) at a longer timescale is not ruled out. However, for achieving a mixed PEO and LLZO Li conductivity in a composite electrolyte, the timescale of the exchange must be considerably shorter [35].\n\nAlthough the incorporation of a large fraction of LLZO is at first expected to improve the ionic conductivity of the CPEs, they usually show rather low ionic conductivities. As previously explained by Waidha et al. [39], at high LLZO content, there exists a high amount of unsintered ceramic\u2014ceramic interphases, resulting in a huge grain boundary resistance and low ionic conductivity. Additionally,\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 4.  $^{7}$ Li EXSY solid-state NMR spectra of a, b) CP80 and c, d) CA80 at 600 ms.

As shown in Fig. 6a, our garnet-rich CPEs containing 80 wt% pristine and heattreated LLZO are no exceptions, and their ionic conductivities are rather low at room temperature (RT) but high enough to operate in a device at 70 \u00b0C. Fig. 6a also depicts a decrease in the ionic conductivity, upon increasing the garnet fraction to 90 wt%. This is well in agreement with the previous studies [18,39,40] and indicates that the ion transport is mainly happening through the polymeric phase, and the LLZO particles are not directly contributing to the ion conduction. This could be mainly due to the absence of continuous ion-transport pathways through the ceramic phase, high grain-boundary resistance, and high activation energy for the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange between the polymer and ceramic phase. The addition of 1D or 2D ceramic networks such as nanowires or nanosheets is among the possible approaches to address this issue [41\u201344].\n\nFrom Fig. 6a, it is observed that both in the case of 80 and 90 wt% LLZO fraction, the membranes with heat-treated LLZO show better ionic conductivities in the whole temperature range. Although the enhancement is rather small, it can be attributed to the more homogeneous distribution of the LLZO particles in the polymer matrix and the better PEO/LLZO interface in composite electrolytes containing heat-treated LLZO. In fact, in CA80, uniform distribution of the polymer phase throughout the membrane could lead to a facile Li-ion mobility within the ceramic-rich membrane, while in CP80 the phase segregation and poor distribution of the PEO phase, results in higher resistance and lower ionic conductivity. As demonstrated in Fig. 6b, the enhancement of ionic conductivity\n\nupon heat treatment, is more significant at 90 wt% LLZO content than in the case of 80 wt%, due to higher phase segregation. The homogenous distributions of the polymer phase in CA80 and phase segregation observed in the polymer matrix in CP80 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6c. The higher ionic conductivity of CA80 at first seems to contradict its lower local ion mobilities shown by NMR. However, one should not forget that the impedance spectroscopy probes Li dynamics at a much longer range and lower frequency than the NMR, and therefore they should not be directly compared.\n\nAlthough the LLZO/PEO interface has been previously proposed as a possible pathway for Li conduction through the membrane, the contribution to the present system appears to be rather low, because in that case, higher ionic conductivities would be expected for CPEs with 90 wt% LLZO compared to 80 wt% LLZO. This is in agreement with previous studies [12]. However, it must be noted that multiple parameters such as filler size and morphology, as well as salt content and PEO molecular weight, could affect the properties of the interfacial layer.\n\nThe cyclic voltammetry experiments were conducted to evaluate the Li plating/stripping kinetics. As shown in Fig. 7a, the plating peak at negative potentials is considerably sharper in CA80, indicating much better plating/stripping characteristics compared to CP80. The broad peak of CP80 implies a more sluggish Li plating, which is in good agreement with its poor microstructural features. For further investigation on the reversible electrodeposition of Li metal in CP80 and CA80, galvanostatic cycling tests were performed for both samples in symmetrical Li metal configuration, and the voltage profiles are demonstrated in Fig. 7b. It can be observed\n\n<span id=\"page-5-1\"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nFig. 6. a) Arrhenius plots of CP80, CA80, CP90, and CA90. b) Comparison of lonic conductivity of samples at 70 \u00b0C.

While the first one was analyzed in the previous section, the latter was studied by recording the impedance spectra of CP80 and CA80 in symmetrical Li cells. As depicted in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)c, it is evident that the second semicircle at low-frequency region, ascribed to the Li metal/electrolyte resistance, is considerably smaller in CA80 than in CP80. The area-specific resistance was calculated to be 2,263 and 270 U cm2 for CP80 and CA80 respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that heat treatment of LLZO improves the Li metal/ electrolyte interface. This is also confirmed by comparing the impedance spectra of the cells recorded after the plating/stripping test, shown in Fig. S.3. In addition to the lower overpotential, the voltage profile during the 500 h of cycling, as presented in Fig. S.4, remains flatter and more stable in CA80 compared to CP80. This implies a more homogenous and uniform Li plating and stripping, bringing out the improvements of the CPEs on the solid state battery (SSB) performance. The plating/stripping test for both cells was continued at a higher current (80 mA/cm2 ) and the overpotentials were presented in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)d. The overpotential profile of CA80 is steady and has a rather low amplitude, while the one of CP80 is unstable with high amplitudes up to 5 V. In addition, CP80 was short circuited after 270 h while CA80 continues cycling for over 800 h. Such high cyclability despite low ionic conductivity could be attributed to the high mechanical properties of the CPE membranes. The significant difference in the performance at different current densities evidently show that the improvements in the Li plating and stripping are more pronounced at higher current densities, as the Li metal/electrolyte interface would play a bigger role in uniform Li plating.\n\n## 4. Concluding remarks\n\nIn the present work, which continues our previous study of LLZO heat treatment and its impact on its interfacial properties, it is shown that heat treatment clearly improves the morphological, mechanical, and Li transport properties of garnet-rich CPEs with high LLZO fraction (>80 wt%). The SEM analysis showed that the composites prepared with heat-treated LLZO are more homogenous and have less particle agglomeration when compared to composites with pristine LLZO. NMR results show that the heat treatment of LLZO had a negative effect on Li\u00fe exchange between LLZO and the polymer matrix, indicating that the Li\u00fe exchange is more affected by the presence of LiOH in the interface, rather than the faster Li\u00fe dynamics of LLZO after heat treatment. The comparison of ionic conductivities reveals that ion conduction happens mainly through the polymeric phase because the grain boundary resistance is too high for facile ion transport through the inorganic phase. LLZO heat treatment improved the ionic conductivity of garnet-rich CPEs, and this improvement was more significant when LLZO content was increased, highlighting the negative effect of LLZO agglomeration and phase segregation on obstructing the Li\u00fe pathways. Therefore, the more homogenous microstructure of CPEs with heat-treated LLZO is responsible for their higher ionic conductivity.\n\nDespite improvements in morphology and ionic conductivity, ion conduction is mainly happening through the polymer phase, and the high ionic conductivity of LLZO is not extracted in CPEs, even when the LLZO fraction reaches 90 wt%. Based on the hypothesis that the grain boundary resistance is the main issue in this matter, we propose using 1D and 2D ceramic networks to facilitate ion conduction through the inorganic phase. These systems will be investigated in a future work.\n\n### Author contributions\n\nPG: investigation, formal analysis, writing-original draft, writing-review & editing.

The micrograph of CP80 (Fig. 1a and c) shows that LLZO particles are agglomerated, and the two phases (polymer and ceramic) are segregated.

Almost all LLZO particles are homogenously covered by PEO and the polymer distribution is rather uniform. The improved LLZO wetting by the polymer implies stronger interactions between PEO and LLZO after the heat treatment.

Fig. 2 shows the characteristic mechanical response for solid polymer electrolytes, where a typical thermoplastic behavior is observed, with two characteristic regions, the elastic, and the plastic regimes. It can be observed that the addition of LLZO improves the mechanical properties of the membranes, in the sense that the ceramic particles act as mechanical reinforcement. Table 1 presents the Young's modulus, yield stress, and elongation at break of each sample. PEO/ LiTFSI membrane shows the lowest yield stress (0.41 MPa) but the highest elongation at break. CA80 on the other hand, possesses the highest yield stress (0.91 MPa), with a Young's modulus similar to CP80 (~35 MPa) but considerably higher than the one of PEO/LiTFSI (2.1 MPa), indicating that the addition of LLZO increases the stiffness of the membranes. CP80 shows a significantly lower elongation at break (42.7 %) compared to CA80 and PEO/LiTFSI (109.8 and 83.7%), which is in line with its phase-segregated microstructure in which LLZO particles are agglomerated and PEO matrix is not uniformly distributed. The lower yield stress of CP80 can also be explained by the poor PEO/LLZO interactions, in agreement with SEM micrographs. On the contrary, in CA80 the homogenous distribution of PEO and the stronger PEO/LLZO interactions (wettability of the LLZO by the polymer) noticeably increase the yield stress and the elongation at break. Overall, the mechanical properties of CA80 are suitable for solid-state batteries [31]. In any case,\n\n<span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

Despite a lower resolution, <sup>7</sup> Li was preferred over <sup>6</sup> Li, due to its higher sensibility and shorter relaxation time. The <sup>7</sup> Li MAS-NMR spectra of CA80 and CP80 are shown in [Fig. 3a](#page-3-2). In the latter, two main signals are observed centered at 1.3 and 0.5 ppm, corresponding to the Li<sup>\u00fe</sup> in the polymer matrix and LLZO, respectively [\\[35,](#page-7-28)[36](#page-8-0)]. Comparing the two spectra, a clear difference in the Li signal of LLZO and Li ions in the polymer phase is observed. In CA80, the <sup>7</sup> Li signal of LLZO at 1.2 ppm is evidently narrower (207 Hz) than the one of CP80 centered at 0.5 ppm (550 Hz). Linewidth (FWHM), in NMR experiments, is generally related to the local dynamics, as anisotropic interactions can be averaged out with fast ion or molecular motions [[37,](#page-8-1)[38](#page-8-2)]. Variable temperature NMR experiments are desirable to separate the effect of dynamics from the intrinsic broadenings due to the local chemical environments. However, such experiments are complicated in composites where multiple overlapped signals are present. On the other hand, considering the similar chemical compositions of CP80 and CA80, the intrinsic broadening due to the local chemical environment is assumed to be similar, we can conclude that the differences in the linewidth are the consequences of local dynamics.\n\nThe sharper <sup>7</sup> Li signal of LLZO in CA80 is assigned to the formation of the highly conductive cubic phase after heat treatment, the elimination of protons from the LLZO structure, and the removal of Li2CO3 and LiOH from the LLZO surface [[28](#page-7-21)]. As a result of this lower linewidth, the signals are less overlapped and better resolved.

These results indicate that both PEO matrix and the Li ions dissolved in the polymer show higher mobility in CP80. This can be explained by the inhomogeneous distribution of LLZO, the segregation of LLZO and polymer phases and the weak interactions between the LLZO and PEO matrix. On the other hand, in CA80, the PEO mobility is restricted due to a stronger interaction of the PEO and the 'clean' LLZO surface. Since the polymer dynamics and the local mobilities of Li\u00fe ions in PEO are generally correlated, slower Li dynamics are also observed in CA80. These strong surface interactions are also responsible for the optimum polymer dispersion and improved mechanical properties.",

          "text": "A key aspect of the development of composite electrolytes is the ability of Li<sup>\u00fe</sup> ions to rapidly diffuse through the garnetepolymer interface. If the exchange rate is fast enough, this phenomenon could greatly affect the Li-ion pathways through the membranes and the observed conductivities. In our previous investigations on ceramic-polymer composite electrolytes with 10 vol% LLZO [35,36], the Li-ion exchange in the interface was observed and followed by NMR. However, the activation energy for this process was found to be too high for the contribution of this Li<sup>+</sup> exchange process to the total ionic conductivity of the membranes [35]. Since the presence of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> with its slow Li<sup>+</sup> dynamics on the surface of the LLZO particles could block or slow down the ion exchange and be responsible for the high activation energy of this process, it was expected that removing them through heat treatment could facilitate the exchange in the interface. On the other hand, in a previous work, LiOH was proposed as a possible intermediate for the Li+ exchange. Solid-state 2D EXSY NMR experiments were carried out in this work to assess the effect of heat pre-treatment of the LLZO particles in the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange in CP80 and CA80.\n\nFig. 4 shows <sup>7</sup>Li-<sup>7</sup>Li EXSY NMR experiments performed on CPEs with a mixing time of 600 ms. The signals on the diagonal line at 0.4 and \u22121.3 ppm correspond to the Li ions in the LLZO and polymer matrix respectively, while the off-diagonal signals (cross-peaks) connecting both signals indicate the amplitude of Li exchange existing between the two chemical environments within the mixing time of the experiment (0.6 s). By the inspection of the figures, it is clear that the off-diagonal signals in the case of CA80 are smaller than CP80. This is also confirmed by the calculation of the relative integral volumes of the off-diagonal signals with respect to the main diagonal ones. The obtained values are 7.6% in CA80 and 27.1% in CP80. Since the off-diagonal signals correlating the Li signals at the LLZO and PEO sites are proportional to the number of the exchanged ions, we can conclude that a higher number of Li-ions are subject to the Li-exchange in CP80, meaning that heat treatment of the LLZO particles has a negative impact on the amplitude of Li exchange between the PEO and LLZO phases. This can be assigned to the intermediate role of LiOH in the exchange, as suggested by Ranque et al. [35]. After the heat treatment, the LiOH is removed from the LLZO surface, and in the absence of this intermediate phase, fewer Li ions can move between the LLZO and the polymer matrix. It is important to highlight that the negative impact of removing LiOH in the exchange is even more remarkable considering that the extent of the LLZO-PEO interaction (LLZO wettability by the polymer) is much higher in the CA80 sample.",

The projections of the HETCOR spectra on the  ${}^{1}\\text{H}$  dimension were extracted and are presented in Fig. 5c. Three signals can be observed at -2.1, 0.8, and 3.6 ppm, corresponding to LiOH, water molecules adsorbed on the LLZO surface, and protons inside the\n\nLLZO structure respectively [28]. All these three spin reservoirs do result in signals in the  ${}^{1}H-{}^{7}Li$  correlation, due to the presence of distinct <sup>1</sup>H to <sup>7</sup>Li couples in the materials. Signals obtained from CP experiments are generally not quantitative, as they are strongly affected by differences in internuclear distances and local motions. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that these factors are not much different for the same compounds in different samples. Fig. 5c clearly shows a considerably lower amount of LiOH, as well as protons inside LLZO in CA80. However, as shown in Fig. S.1, the middle signal at 0.8 ppm which is assigned to adsorbed water molecules on the LLZO surface, has a similar intensity in both CP80 and CA80, indicating a limit for possible water adsorption on the LLZO surface. In CP80, the correlation of this signal with <sup>7</sup>Li is less clear in Fig. 5a and c because the signals corresponding to LiOH and protons inside the LLZO are more intense, and the intermediate signal is overlapped. Nevertheless, its presence is confirmed by the deconvolutions shown in Fig. S.2.\n\nTo highlight the role of LiOH in the Li exchange, a pseudo-3D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>6</sup>Li CP experiment was conducted. In this experiment, the EXSY step is included after a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>6</sup>Li CP block to increase the signal of the less mobile units (LiOH in this case). CP signals are based on dipolar couplings, hence the signal coming from rigid compounds with lower H-Li distances would be more intense. However, for the same reason, CP signals are not quantitative. The results presented in Fig. 5d, demonstrate the presence of Li exchange between LiOH and LLZO, as well as between LiOH and PEO in CP80, where a high amount of LiOH exists. However, in the CA80 the signals are extremely weak, and no cross-peak is observed. A comparison of signal intensity in CP80 and CA80 is presented in Fig. S.2. It can be concluded that LiOH plays a critical role in the Li exchange in the LLZO-PEO interface. Therefore, LLZO heat treatment limits the Li exchange by eliminating the intermediate LiOH. The results suggest that the Li exchange is more affected by the surface chemistry of LLZO rather than the Li dynamics in LLZO and confirms the role of LiOH as an intermediate of the exchange. It must be noted that these observations are within the timescale used in the experiment (tens to hundreds of milliseconds), and the possibility of a direct Li exchange between LLZO and PEO (without involvement of LiOH) at a longer timescale is not ruled out. However, for achieving a mixed PEO and LLZO Li conductivity in a composite electrolyte, the timescale of the exchange must be considerably shorter [35].",

As shown in Fig. 6a, our garnet-rich CPEs containing 80 wt% pristine and heattreated LLZO are no exceptions, and their ionic conductivities are rather low at room temperature (RT) but high enough to operate in a device at 70 \u00b0C. Fig. 6a also depicts a decrease in the ionic conductivity, upon increasing the garnet fraction to 90 wt%. This is well in agreement with the previous studies [18,39,40] and indicates that the ion transport is mainly happening through the polymeric phase, and the LLZO particles are not directly contributing to the ion conduction. This could be mainly due to the absence of continuous ion-transport pathways through the ceramic phase, high grain-boundary resistance, and high activation energy for the Li<sup>+</sup> exchange between the polymer and ceramic phase. The addition of 1D or 2D ceramic networks such as nanowires or nanosheets is among the possible approaches to address this issue [41\u201344].\n\nFrom Fig. 6a, it is observed that both in the case of 80 and 90 wt% LLZO fraction, the membranes with heat-treated LLZO show better ionic conductivities in the whole temperature range. Although the enhancement is rather small, it can be attributed to the more homogeneous distribution of the LLZO particles in the polymer matrix and the better PEO/LLZO interface in composite electrolytes containing heat-treated LLZO. In fact, in CA80, uniform distribution of the polymer phase throughout the membrane could lead to a facile Li-ion mobility within the ceramic-rich membrane, while in CP80 the phase segregation and poor distribution of the PEO phase, results in higher resistance and lower ionic conductivity. As demonstrated in Fig. 6b, the enhancement of ionic conductivity\n\nupon heat treatment, is more significant at 90 wt% LLZO content than in the case of 80 wt%, due to higher phase segregation. The homogenous distributions of the polymer phase in CA80 and phase segregation observed in the polymer matrix in CP80 are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6c. The higher ionic conductivity of CA80 at first seems to contradict its lower local ion mobilities shown by NMR. However, one should not forget that the impedance spectroscopy probes Li dynamics at a much longer range and lower frequency than the NMR, and therefore they should not be directly compared.\n\nAlthough the LLZO/PEO interface has been previously proposed as a possible pathway for Li conduction through the membrane, the contribution to the present system appears to be rather low, because in that case, higher ionic conductivities would be expected for CPEs with 90 wt% LLZO compared to 80 wt% LLZO. This is in agreement with previous studies [12]. However, it must be noted that multiple parameters such as filler size and morphology, as well as salt content and PEO molecular weight, could affect the properties of the interfacial layer.",

Concluding remarks\n\nIn the present work, which continues our previous study of LLZO heat treatment and its impact on its interfacial properties, it is shown that heat treatment clearly improves the morphological, mechanical, and Li transport properties of garnet-rich CPEs with high LLZO fraction (>80 wt%). The SEM analysis showed that the composites prepared with heat-treated LLZO are more homogenous and have less particle agglomeration when compared to composites with pristine LLZO. NMR results show that the heat treatment of LLZO had a negative effect on Li\u00fe exchange between LLZO and the polymer matrix, indicating that the Li\u00fe exchange is more affected by the presence of LiOH in the interface, rather than the faster Li\u00fe dynamics of LLZO after heat treatment. The comparison of ionic conductivities reveals that ion conduction happens mainly through the polymeric phase because the grain boundary resistance is too high for facile ion transport through the inorganic phase. LLZO heat treatment improved the ionic conductivity of garnet-rich CPEs, and this improvement was more significant when LLZO content was increased, highlighting the negative effect of LLZO agglomeration and phase segregation on obstructing the Li\u00fe pathways. Therefore, the more homogenous microstructure of CPEs with heat-treated LLZO is responsible for their higher ionic conductivity.\n\nDespite improvements in morphology and ionic conductivity, ion conduction is mainly happening through the polymer phase, and the high ionic conductivity of LLZO is not extracted in CPEs, even when the LLZO fraction reaches 90 wt%. Based on the hypothesis that the grain boundary resistance is the main issue in this matter, we propose using 1D and 2D ceramic networks to facilitate ion conduction through the inorganic phase. These systems will be investigated in a future work.\n\n### Author contributions\n\nPG: investigation, formal analysis, writing-original draft, writing-review & editing.

The SEM analysis showed that the composites prepared with heat-treated LLZO are more homogenous and have less particle agglomeration when compared to composites with pristine LLZO. NMR results show that the heat treatment of LLZO had a negative effect on Li\u00fe exchange between LLZO and the polymer matrix, indicating that the Li\u00fe exchange is more affected by the presence of LiOH in the interface, rather than the faster Li\u00fe dynamics of LLZO after heat treatment. The comparison of ionic conductivities reveals that ion conduction happens mainly through the polymeric phase because the grain boundary resistance is too high for facile ion transport through the inorganic phase. LLZO heat treatment improved the ionic conductivity of garnet-rich CPEs, and this improvement was more significant when LLZO content was increased, highlighting the negative effect of LLZO agglomeration and phase segregation on obstructing the Li\u00fe pathways. Therefore, the more homogenous microstructure of CPEs with heat-treated LLZO is responsible for their higher ionic conductivity.\n\nDespite improvements in morphology and ionic conductivity, ion conduction is mainly happening through the polymer phase, and the high ionic conductivity of LLZO is not extracted in CPEs, even when the LLZO fraction reaches 90 wt%. Based on the hypothesis that the grain boundary resistance is the main issue in this matter, we propose using 1D and 2D ceramic networks to facilitate ion conduction through the inorganic phase. These systems will be investigated in a future work.\n\n### Author contributions\n\nPG: investigation, formal analysis, writing-original draft, writing-review & editing.

While the first one was analyzed in the previous section, the latter was studied by recording the impedance spectra of CP80 and CA80 in symmetrical Li cells. As depicted in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)c, it is evident that the second semicircle at low-frequency region, ascribed to the Li metal/electrolyte resistance, is considerably smaller in CA80 than in CP80. The area-specific resistance was calculated to be 2,263 and 270 U cm2 for CP80 and CA80 respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that heat treatment of LLZO improves the Li metal/ electrolyte interface. This is also confirmed by comparing the impedance spectra of the cells recorded after the plating/stripping test, shown in Fig. S.3. In addition to the lower overpotential, the voltage profile during the 500 h of cycling, as presented in Fig. S.4, remains flatter and more stable in CA80 compared to CP80. This implies a more homogenous and uniform Li plating and stripping, bringing out the improvements of the CPEs on the solid state battery (SSB) performance. The plating/stripping test for both cells was continued at a higher current (80 mA/cm2 ) and the overpotentials were presented in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)d. The overpotential profile of CA80 is steady and has a rather low amplitude, while the one of CP80 is unstable with high amplitudes up to 5 V. In addition, CP80 was short circuited after 270 h while CA80 continues cycling for over 800 h. Such high cyclability despite low ionic conductivity could be attributed to the high mechanical properties of the CPE membranes.

In addition to the lower overpotential, the voltage profile during the 500 h of cycling, as presented in Fig. S.4, remains flatter and more stable in CA80 compared to CP80. This implies a more homogenous and uniform Li plating and stripping, bringing out the improvements of the CPEs on the solid state battery (SSB) performance. The plating/stripping test for both cells was continued at a higher current (80 mA/cm2 ) and the overpotentials were presented in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)d. The overpotential profile of CA80 is steady and has a rather low amplitude, while the one of CP80 is unstable with high amplitudes up to 5 V. In addition, CP80 was short circuited after 270 h while CA80 continues cycling for over 800 h. Such high cyclability despite low ionic conductivity could be attributed to the high mechanical properties of the CPE membranes. The significant difference in the performance at different current densities evidently show that the improvements in the Li plating and stripping are more pronounced at higher current densities, as the Li metal/electrolyte interface would play a bigger role in uniform Li plating.\n\n## 4. Concluding remarks\n\nIn the present work, which continues our previous study of LLZO heat treatment and its impact on its interfacial properties, it is shown that heat treatment clearly improves the morphological, mechanical, and Li transport properties of garnet-rich CPEs with high LLZO fraction (>80 wt%). The SEM analysis showed that the composites prepared with heat-treated LLZO are more homogenous and have less particle agglomeration when compared to composites with pristine LLZO. NMR results show that the heat treatment of LLZO had a negative effect on Li\u00fe exchange between LLZO and the polymer matrix, indicating that the Li\u00fe exchange is more affected by the presence of LiOH in the interface, rather than the faster Li\u00fe dynamics of LLZO after heat treatment. The comparison of ionic conductivities reveals that ion conduction happens mainly through the polymeric phase because the grain boundary resistance is too high for facile ion transport through the inorganic phase. LLZO heat treatment improved the ionic conductivity of garnet-rich CPEs, and this improvement was more significant when LLZO content was increased, highlighting the negative effect of LLZO agglomeration and phase segregation on obstructing the Li\u00fe pathways. Therefore, the more homogenous microstructure of CPEs with heat-treated LLZO is responsible for their higher ionic conductivity.\n\nDespite improvements in morphology and ionic conductivity, ion conduction is mainly happening through the polymer phase, and the high ionic conductivity of LLZO is not extracted in CPEs, even when the LLZO fraction reaches 90 wt%. Based on the hypothesis that the grain boundary resistance is the main issue in this matter, we propose using 1D and 2D ceramic networks to facilitate ion conduction through the inorganic phase. These systems will be investigated in a future work.\n\n### Author contributions\n\nPG: investigation, formal analysis, writing-original draft, writing-review & editing.

While the first one was analyzed in the previous section, the latter was studied by recording the impedance spectra of CP80 and CA80 in symmetrical Li cells. As depicted in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)c, it is evident that the second semicircle at low-frequency region, ascribed to the Li metal/electrolyte resistance, is considerably smaller in CA80 than in CP80. The area-specific resistance was calculated to be 2,263 and 270 U cm2 for CP80 and CA80 respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that heat treatment of LLZO improves the Li metal/ electrolyte interface. This is also confirmed by comparing the impedance spectra of the cells recorded after the plating/stripping test, shown in Fig. S.3. In addition to the lower overpotential, the voltage profile during the 500 h of cycling, as presented in Fig. S.4, remains flatter and more stable in CA80 compared to CP80. This implies a more homogenous and uniform Li plating and stripping, bringing out the improvements of the CPEs on the solid state battery (SSB) performance. The plating/stripping test for both cells was continued at a higher current (80 mA/cm2 ) and the overpotentials were presented in [Fig. 7](#page-6-0)d. The overpotential profile of CA80 is steady and has a rather low amplitude, while the one of CP80 is unstable with high amplitudes up to 5 V. In addition, CP80 was short circuited after 270 h while CA80 continues cycling for over 800 h. Such high cyclability despite low ionic conductivity could be attributed to the high mechanical properties of the CPE membranes. The significant difference in the performance at different current densities evidently show that the improvements in the Li plating and stripping are more pronounced at higher current densities, as the Li metal/electrolyte interface would play a bigger role in uniform Li plating.",

          "text": "## 4. Concluding remarks\n\nIn the present work, which continues our previous study of LLZO heat treatment and its impact on its interfacial properties, it is shown that heat treatment clearly improves the morphological, mechanical, and Li transport properties of garnet-rich CPEs with high LLZO fraction (>80 wt%). The SEM analysis showed that the composites prepared with heat-treated LLZO are more homogenous and have less particle agglomeration when compared to composites with pristine LLZO. NMR results show that the heat treatment of LLZO had a negative effect on Li\u00fe exchange between LLZO and the polymer matrix, indicating that the Li\u00fe exchange is more affected by the presence of LiOH in the interface, rather than the faster Li\u00fe dynamics of LLZO after heat treatment. The comparison of ionic conductivities reveals that ion conduction happens mainly through the polymeric phase because the grain boundary resistance is too high for facile ion transport through the inorganic phase. LLZO heat treatment improved the ionic conductivity of garnet-rich CPEs, and this improvement was more significant when LLZO content was increased, highlighting the negative effect of LLZO agglomeration and phase segregation on obstructing the Li\u00fe pathways. Therefore, the more homogenous microstructure of CPEs with heat-treated LLZO is responsible for their higher ionic conductivity.\n\nDespite improvements in morphology and ionic conductivity, ion conduction is mainly happening through the polymer phase, and the high ionic conductivity of LLZO is not extracted in CPEs, even when the LLZO fraction reaches 90 wt%. Based on the hypothesis that the grain boundary resistance is the main issue in this matter, we propose using 1D and 2D ceramic networks to facilitate ion conduction through the inorganic phase. These systems will be investigated in a future work.",
          "summary": "This section summarizes the findings that heat treatment of LLZO improves the morphological, mechanical, and Li transport properties of garnet-rich CPEs. It also identifies that ion conduction primarily occurs through the polymer phase and proposes future research directions involving 1D and 2D ceramic networks to enhance inorganic phase ion conduction.",

Introduction\nThe availability of large, web accessible, heterogeneous repositories of electronic documents is \nincreasing rapidly [1]. Most of this information is in the form of unstructured text, making the infor -\nmation hard to query [2]. Defining metadata for such documents will be useful for searching, brows-ing, and filtering. Ideally, metadata is defined by the authors of documents and is then used by various systems. However, people seldom define document metadata by themselves, even when they have convenient metadata definition tools [3]. Hence, automatically extracting metadata from the bodies of documents is an important research issue.\nAutomated document structure extraction has a number of benefits. Firstly, it makes automated \nmark-up possible. This helps to preserve information which might be required from the docu -\nment in the future. In addition, documents with logical structure can be presented differently for different devices. This flexibility in presentation is very useful to handle different devices. For example, a document can be presented differently in a PDA and in a web browser. Keeping docu -\nment logical structure also allows different users to have different access to a document. Some users may have unlimited access to a document while other users may have some limitations, for example, a textbook in which a professor has access to the answers as well as questions and a \nCorrespondence to: Bolanle Adefowoke Ojokoh, Department of Computer Science, P.M.B. 704, Akure, \nNigeria.

For example, a document can be searched in a specific section, such as the introduction. It also allows search by some complex objects such as equations.

Review of related studies\nMetadata is, most generally, data that describes other data to enhance their usefulness in content exploration [6]. Several methods have been used for automatic metadata extraction from documents; regular expressions, rule-based parsers and machine learning are the most popular [4]. Liddy et al. [7] and Yilmazel et al. [8] developed rule-based systems founded on natural language processing technologies to extract metadata from educational materials. Mao et al. [9] performed metadata extraction using rule-based methods, particularly using rules based on formatting information which would not be possible with text files. Using a machine learning approach, Hu and colleagues [10] extracted titles from general documents. Han et al. [4] carried out metadata extraction. They viewed the problem as that of classifying the lines in a document into the categories of metadata and proposed using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the classifier. They mainly used linguistic information as features. They reported high extraction accuracy from research papers in terms of precision and recall.

Most of these researches, however, focused on extraction from research papers that have most of the metadata to be extracted located on the first page of the paper [10]. Moreover, most of them carried out the task of metadata extraction for just a single metadata, such as author names or titles, only [13, 14].

This research combines the idea of extracting the structure of documents using keywords with regular expressions to extract metadata from documents.\n3. Document metadata extraction architecture\nThe developed system is made up of six components, four modules (Converter, Segmentation Engine, Parser and Browser), each carrying out its own function towards the task of metadata extrac-tion, and the Input and Output of the system. Equations (1)–(13) describe these components, their functions and relationship mathematically.\nThe Document Metadata Extractor, D is a 6-tuple (I, C, S, P, B, O)\nD = (I, C, S, P, B, O)  (1)\nwhere I is the Input, C is the Converter, S is the Segmentation Engine, P is the Parser, B is the \nBrowser and O is the Output.\n(i) I:p (2)Bolanle Adefowoke Ojokoh et al.\nJournal of Information Science, 35 (5) 2009, pp. 563–570 © CILIP, DOI: 10.1177/0165551509105195 565where p is the uploaded document needing conversion.\n(ii) Cp → t  (3)\nand\nt = {b1, b2, ..., bn} (4)\nwhere t is the text document and bn refers to block n in the document.\n(iii) S is a 2-tuple (M, G) (5)\nwhere M refers to the map function and G refers to the group function.\n(a) M: bi → sk (6)\nwhere sk refers to the set of identified pattern strings\n(b) G: {bi | sk = si, ..., n} where i ≠ k (7)\nStep (b) is repeated until all grouping is done.\n∃bn\ni: t · n is the number of groups in which bi occurs\n(iv) P: merge bi1,..,n → bi (8)\nthen,\nE: (bi * mdi * si) → {mdi,bi} (9)\nmd ∈ {abstract, tableofcontents, introduction, references} (10)\nwhere E is the extract function and md refers to the set of extracted metadata.\nTitle extraction is done with a different method as follows:\ntitle ∈ {[A–Z] * |first 1–100 characters|1st three lines (11)\n(vi) ∀mdi extracted, B displays O ∈ {title, mdi, bi} (12)\nT:(D:u, mdi, ...4, bi, ...n)  (13)\nwhere T is the store function and D is the database.\nThis research work used an approach implementing the model combining segmentation by keyword \ntogether with the use of regular expressions, as presented earlier, to extract some set of metadata \nfrom documents. Title extraction is another challenging task that may not be easily done using only segmentation by keyword as titles of documents are not usually labelled. In this research some sets of rules were proposed for title extraction. Figure 1 describes the architecture of the document meta-data extractor.\nSegmentation is the generation of hierarchy of logical divisions from a document. This layout segmen -\ntation captures the divisions of the document’s logical structure. It can be done in three ways [15]:\n• Segmentation by spacing: by using spacing information, scanned images are separated into sev-\neral areas which can be text, figure/table, or formulae areas.\n• Segmentation by style difference: for each text area, the average size of the characters contained in \nthe area is calculated. The size of a character can be determined by its height. Also boldness can be \ncalculated by the horizontal width of a character. In an area where the styles (bold, italic and size) of lines are obviously different from those of other lines, they are separately segmented.\n• Segmentation by keywords: in an area, where a special keyword (e.g. abstract, references) comes at \nthe beginning of a line, basically the area is segmented before the line as used in this research.

Conclusions and further research directions\nThis paper describes a method for general metadata extraction from general documents using a combination of the segmentation by keyword algorithm and regular expressions.
